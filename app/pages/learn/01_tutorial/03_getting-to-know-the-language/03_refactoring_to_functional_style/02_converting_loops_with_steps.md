## Iterating with Steps

In the previous article in this [tutorial series](id:refactoring) we looked at converting simple loops written in the imperative style to the functional style. In this article we'll see how to take on loops that are a bit more complex&mdash;when we have to step over some values in an interval.

When looping over a range of values, one at a time, the `range()` method of `IntStream` came in handy to implement in the functional style. This method returns a stream that will generate one value at a time for values within the specified range. At first thought, to skip some values we may be tempted to use the `filter()` method on the stream. However, there's a simpler solution, the `iterate()` method of `IntStream`.

## From Imperative to Functional Style

Here's a loop that uses step to skip a few values in the desired range:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 15; i = i + 3) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

The value of the index variable `i` starts at `0` and then is incremented by `3` as the iteration moves forward. When you find yourself looking at a loop like that where the iteration is not over every single value in a range, but some values are skipped, consider using the `iterate()` method of `IntStream`.

Before we refactor the code, let's take a closer look at the `for` loop in the previous code, but with a pair of imaginary glasses that let us look at potential uses for lambdas.

```java
// Imaginary code
for (int i = 0; i < 15; i = i + 3) // Imperative
for (seed, i -> i < 15, i -> i + 3) // Functional
```

The first argument passed to the `for` loop is the starting value or the seed for the iteration and it can stay as is. The second argument is a predicate that tells the value of the index variable, `i`, should not exceed the value of `15`. We can replace that in the functional style with a `IntPredicate`. The third argument is incrementing the value of the index variable and that, in functional style, is simply a `IntUnaryOperator`. The `IntStream` interface has a `static` method named `iterate()` that nicely represents the imaginary code: `iterate(int seed, IntPredicate hasNext, IntUnaryOperator next)`.

Let's refactor the loop to use functional style.

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

...
IntStream.iterate(0, i -> i < 15, i -> i + 3)
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```

That was pretty straightforward, the `;`s became `,`s, we made use of two lambdas: one for the `IntPredicate` and the other for the `IntUnaryOperator`.

In addition to stepping over values, we often use an unbounded loop and that throws a bit more complexity on us, but nothing the functional APIs of Java can't handle, as we'll see next.

<a id="break">&nbsp;</a>
## Unbounded Iteration with a break 

Let's take a look at the following imperative style loop which, in addition to the step, is unbounded and uses the `break` statement.

```java
for (int i = 0;; i = i + 3) {
  if (i > 20) {
    break;
  }

  System.out.println(i);
}
```

The terminating condition of `i < 15` is gone and the loop is unbounded as indicated by the repeated `;;`s. Within the loop, however, we have the `break` statement to exit out of the iteration if the value of `i` is greater than `20`.

For the functional style, we can get rid of the second argument, the `IntPredicate` from the `iterate()` method call but that will turn the iteration into an infinite stream. The functional programming equivalent of the imperative style `break` is the `takeWhile()` method. This method will terminate the internal iterator, the stream, if the `IntPredicate` passed to it evaluates to `false`. Let's refactor the previous imperative style unbounded `for` with `break` to functional style.

```java
IntStream.iterate(0, i -> i + 3)
  .takeWhile(i -> i <= 20)
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```

The `iterate()` method is overloaded and comes in two flavors, one with the `IntPredicate` and the other without. We made use of the version without the predicate to create an infinite stream that generates values from the seed or the starting value. The `IntUnaryOperator` passed as the second argument determines the steps. Thus, in the given code example, the stream will generate values `0`, `3`, `6`, and so on. Since we want to limit the iteration so that the index does not exceed the value of `20` we use the `takeWhile()`. The predicate passed in to `takeWhile()` tells that the iteration may continue as long as the value of the parameter given, the index `i`, does not exceed the value of `20`.

We saw in the previous article that `range()` and `rangeClosed()` are direct replacement for the simple `for` loop. If the loop gets a bit more complex, no worries, Java has you covered, you can use the `IntStream`'s `iterate()` method and optionally the `takeWhile()` if the loop is terminated using `break`.

## Mappings

Anywhere you see a `for` loop with step, use the `iterate()` method with three arguments, a seed or the starting value, a `IntPredicate` for the terminating condition, and a `IntUnaryOperator` for the steps. If your loop uses the `break` statement, then drop the `IntPredicate` from the `iterate()` method call and instead use the `takeWhile()` method. The `takeWhile()` is the functional equivalent of the imperative style `break`.
